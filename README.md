# Bottles Defects Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks for the analysis of defects in plastic bottles using computer vision techniques. The work is based on the MVTec AD dataset and was developed for the *Vision for Industry and Environment* course at the University of Milano-Bicocca.

- **Detection notebook**: anomaly detection on bottle images.
- **Segmentation notebook**: pixel-wise defect segmentation.

## Requirements

- Python â‰¥ 3.10
- All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`

Install with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to use

1. Prepare the dataset as described in the notebooks.
2. Open and run:
   - `detection.ipynb` for anomaly detection
   - `segmentation.ipynb` for defect segmentation
